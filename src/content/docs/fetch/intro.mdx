`react-fetch` is a lightweight and straightforward React package designed to simplify data fetching in React applications. It provides an intuitive way to make HTTP requests and manage the state of the data, loading, and errors within your components.

## Features

- Build with typescript.
- Build on top of fetch.
- useScrollRestoration to restore scroll position.
- FetchProvider to inject configs like token, header, etc.
- useFetch tries to prevent "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component".
- Centralize request into a unique place, with HttpService.
- Together with @resourge/http-service it will also abort request on component unmount. (@resourge/http-service is not mandatory but otherwise this functionality will need the developer to do it)
- Global, local components and LoadingService to centralize showing Loaders.

## Installation

Install using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn add @resourge/react-fetch
```

or NPM:

```sh
npm install @resourge/react-fetch --save
```

## React-native

To use in react-native, it requires to use [react-native-url-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-url-polyfill)

```sh
// index.js
// Add
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
```


## Usage

To use useFetch, import it into your React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import {
  useFetch
} from '@resourge/react-fetch'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const {
    data,
    error,
    fetch,
    isLoading,
    setFetchState
  } = useFetch(
    () => {
      return Http.get("url");
    },
    {
      initialState: []
    }
  );

  // Use data, error, fetch, isLoading, and setFetchState as needed

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Parameters

useFetch accepts two parameters:

1. `method`: A function that performs the data fetching. It should return a Promise that resolves with the fetched data.
2. `config`: An optional configuration object with the following properties:
	- `enable` (boolean, default: true): When `false`, `useEffect` will not trigger fetch.
	- `loadingService` (string): Specifies a specific `LoadingService` instead of triggering the global one.
	- `deps` (readonly array): `useEffect` dependencies.
	- `id` (string): Assign a unique ID to the fetch request.
	- `initialState` (any): Default data values.
	- `onEffectEnd` (function): A function that executes only after `useEffect` completes.
	- `scrollRestoration` (function or array of functions): Functions to restore scroll position.


### Examples

Fetch as `useState` and `useEffect`

```javascript
const {
  data,
  error,
  fetch,
  isLoading,
  setFetchState
} = useFetch(
  () => {
    return Http.get("url");
  },
  {
    initialState: []
  }
);

```

Fetch as `useEffect` 

```javascript
const {
  error,
  fetch,
  isLoading
} = useFetch(
  () => {
    return Http.get("url");
  },
  {
    deps: []
  }
);
```

Only fetch

```javascript
const {
  error,
  fetch,
  isLoading
} = useFetch(
  () => {
    return Http.get("url");
  }
);
```

## `Loading` Behavior

The `Loading` in `useFetch` can behave either globally or locally, depending on its usage within the useFetch hook.

- `Global Loading`: By default, `loading` will trigger a global loading state if not used within the component where useFetch is called. This means it will update a global loading indicator, potentially affecting other components listening for loading state changes.

- `Local Loading`: If `isLoading` is used within the component's rendering logic, `loading` will only trigger locally. This allows for more granular control over loading states within different parts of the application.

### Examples

In the following example, isLoading is used within the component's rendering logic, causing it to trigger a local loading state:

```javascript
const {
  data,
  error,
  fetch,
  isLoading,
  setFetchState
} = useFetch(
  () => {
    return Http.get("url");
  },
  {
    initialState: []
  }
);

return (
  <div>
    {isLoading ? (
      <p>Loading...</p>
    ) : (
      <p>Data: {data}</p>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

To trigger a global loading state, don't use isLoading from usFetch

```javascript
const {
  data,
  error,
  fetch,
  setFetchState
} = useFetch(
  () => {
    return Http.get("url");
  },
  {
    initialState: [],
    // Optional, for triggering a specific loader other than the global
    // loadingService: 'specificLoadingService' // This will trigger a 
  }
);
```

## Hooks

- `useScrollRestoration`: A hook to restore scroll position after a component unmounts. It accepts an array of functions to restore scroll position.
- `useFetchOnDependencyUpdate`: A hook to fetch data when a dependency updates. It accepts a function that returns a Promise and an array of dependencies.
- `useIsOnline`: A hook to check if the user is online. It returns a boolean value.
