`react-fetch` provides a set of tools to simplify the request process.
Provides useFetch, useScrollRestoration, FetchProvider, HttpService, LoadingService and a Loader and GlobalLoader.

## Features

- Build with typescript.
- Build on top of fetch.
- useScrollRestoration to restore scroll position.
- FetchProvider to inject configs like token, header, etc.
- useFetch tries to prevent "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component".
- Centralize request into a unique place, with HttpService.
- Together with @resourge/http-service it will also abort request on component unmount. (@resourge/http-service is not mandatory but otherwise this functionality will need the developer to do it)
- Global, local components and LoadingService to centralize showing Loaders.

## Installation

Install using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn add @resourge/react-fetch
```

or NPM:

```sh
npm install @resourge/react-fetch --save
```

## React-native

To use in react-native, it requires to use [react-native-url-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-url-polyfill)

```sh
// index.js
// Add
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
```


## Usage

Example of a simple useFetch fetching posts from jsonplaceholder.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useFetch } from '@resourge/react-fetch';
import HttpService from 'shared/services/http-service';

const App = () => {
  const { data: posts, loading, error, fetch } = useFetch(
       async () => await HttpService.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'),
        { initialValue: [] }
    );

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Something went wrong</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => fetch()}>Fetch</button>
      {
		posts.map((val) => (
		  <li key={val.id}>{ val.name }</li>
		))
	  }
    </div>
  );
};

```
