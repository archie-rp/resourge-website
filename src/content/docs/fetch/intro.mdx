`react-fetch` provides a set of tools to simplify the request process.
Provides useFetch, useScrollRestoration, FetchProvider, HttpService, LoadingService and a Loader and GlobalLoader.

## Features

- Build with typescript.
- Build on top of fetch.
- useScrollRestoration to restore scroll position.
- FetchProvider to inject configs like token, header, etc.
- useFetch tries to prevent "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component".
- Centralize request into a unique place, with HttpService.
- Together with @resourge/http-service it will also abort request on component unmount. (@resourge/http-service is not mandatory but otherwise this functionality will need the developer to do it)
- Global, local components and LoadingService to centralize showing Loaders.

## Installation
