# BaseHttpService

`BaseHttpService` is a main service for making requests to a server. It serves as a simple wrapper around the Fetch API, with added features such as request throttling for `GET` requests and support for file uploads.

## Usage

```typescript
import { BaseHttpService } from '@resourge/http-service'

const HttpService = new BaseHttpService({
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token123'
  }
});

```


### Extending BaseHttpService

You can extend `BaseHttpService` to create a specialized service with additional methods or custom configurations:

```typescript
class CustomHttpService extends BaseHttpService {
  constructor() {
    super({
      baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer token123'
      }
    });
  }

  // Add custom methods
  public customMethod() {
    // Custom logic here
  }
}

const CustomService = new CustomHttpService();
CustomService.customMethod();
```
